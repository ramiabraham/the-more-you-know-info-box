"The More You Know" info box shortcode
======================================

Creates an info box via WordPress shortcode. Uses the "The More You Know" old-school branding. It's kinda dumb.

But hey! It does the trick. use it on your site to call out information. Sometimes, you just need one tiny info box, and not a giant shortcode plugin.
